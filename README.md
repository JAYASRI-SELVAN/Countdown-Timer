Overview:
 -This project implements a countdown timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 -The timer interface consists of input fields for minutes and seconds, along with buttons to control the timer (start, stop, reset) and a display area to show the remaining time. 
 -Users can input the desired duration, start the countdown, pause it if needed, and reset it to its initial state.

Objective:
 -The objective of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly countdown timer web application that allows users to set a custom countdown duration in minutes and seconds and provides options to start, stop, and reset the timer.

Features:
 -Input Fields: Users can enter the desired countdown duration in minutes and seconds using the input fields provided.
 -Start Timer: Clicking the "Start" button initializes the countdown timer based on the input provided by the user.
 -Stop Timer: The "Stop" button allows users to pause the countdown timer at any time.
 -Reset Timer: Users can reset the timer to its initial state by clicking the "Reset" button. This action clears the input fields and stops the timer.
 -Validation: The application validates user input to ensure that valid minutes and seconds are provided before starting the timer. If invalid input is detected, an alert message is displayed.
 -Dynamic Display: The timer dynamically updates and displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds format during the countdown.
 -User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and responsive layout for different devices.
